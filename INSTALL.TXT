Both pre-compiled binaries as well as the source code may be
contained in the GMMPS distribution package. Installation 
instructions for both are given below.

The GMMPS users manual is available online at
   
   http://www.gemini.edu/node/10458
   

1. Dependencies
=============================================================

Running GMMPS requires a standard unix-like X11 environment. 
MacOS users should install XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/).
Users of recent Ubuntu releases should start a X11 session.

Compiling GMMPS from sources requires gcc, make, and X11 
development libraries. MacOS users will need to download Xcode
from the Mac App Store and run it at least once to install 
the command line tools. 

GMMPS now comes with all the packages required to compile it 
including Tcl/Tk and Skycat. They are installed into the 
bin and lib directories of GMMPS to keep them isolated from 
any other versions on your system.


2. Configuring pre-compiled binaries
=============================================================

Pre-compiled versions of GMMPS are available for MacOS and 
a few standard flavors of Linux. Untar the distribution file
and then run

    ./gmmps_config.sh

to configure the paths in the GMMPS startup script.


3. Source Code Installation Instructions
=============================================================

Run:

    ./install.sh


4. Launching GMMPS
=============================================================

Launch GMMPS directly from its installation directory:

    gmmps-<version>/bin/gmmps

More conveniently, add gmmps-<version>/bin to your PATH variable:

For 'bash' add this line your .bashrc:
    export PATH=$PATH:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

For 'csh' add this line to your .cshrc:
    setenv PATH ${PATH}:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

Open a new terminal and type:
gmmps &



5. Earlier versions of GMMPS
=============================================================

Earlier version of GMMPS on your system must be renamed, or 
removed from the PATH variable.

To ensure maximum compatibility and the best mask design, 
Gemini Observatory will NOT accept masks that have been 
designed with earlier versions of GMMPS.

GMMPS performs a version check upon startup, and will 
notify you if a new version of GMMPS has become available.
