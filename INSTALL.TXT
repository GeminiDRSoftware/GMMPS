Both pre-compiled binaries as well as the source code may be
contained in the GMMPS distribution package. Installation 
instructions for both are given below.

The GMMPS users manual is available online at
   
https://gmmps-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
   

1. Dependencies
=============================================================

Running GMMPS requires a standard unix-like X11 environment. 
MacOS users should install XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/).
Users of recent Ubuntu releases should start a Xorg session.

Compiling GMMPS from sources requires a C/C++ compiler, make, 
and X11  development libraries. MacOS users will need 
to download Xcode from the Mac App Store and run it at least 
once to install the command line tools. 

GMMPS now comes with all the packages required to compile it 
including Tcl/Tk and Skycat. They are installed into the 
bin and lib directories of GMMPS to keep them isolated from 
any other versions on your system.

The Gemini IRAF package (http://www.gemini.edu/node/11823) is 
also needed to create the input object tables and, if necessary, 
pseudo-images.

2. Configuring pre-compiled binaries
=============================================================

Pre-compiled versions of GMMPS are available for MacOS and 
a few standard flavors of Linux. The compatibility list is not 
exhaustive, it only lists systems that have been tested.

========================  =============== =========================
File                      Compiled on     Compatible With
========================  =============== =========================
gmmps-1.5.1_rh5_32.tgz    CentOS 5
gmmps-1.5.1_rh6_64.tgz    CentOS 6
gmmps-1.5.1_rh7_64.tgz    CentOS 7        Ubuntu 17/18, Fedora 28
gmmps-1.5.1_ub16_64.tgz   Ubuntu 16.04    Ubuntu 17/18
gmmps-1.5.1_macos.tgz     macOS 10.13.6   macOS 10.14/10.15
========================  =============== =========================

Untar the distribution file and then run

cd /some_path/gmmps-<version>
./gmmps_config.sh

to configure the paths in the GMMPS startup script.


3. Source Code Installation Instructions
=============================================================

There are known problems with compiling GMMPS on Ubuntu 17, 18, 
and Fedora 28. Please use the compatible binary releases on these 
operating systems.

Run:

tar xvfz gmmps-<version>.tgz
cd gmmps-<version>
./install.sh

Finally, put /some_path/gmmps-<version>/bin/gmmps in your path.

If you are not able to compile or run GMMPS on a machine, then one alternative is to run it in a compatible operating system within a virtual machine. Gemini has one Linux virtual machine available for running GMMPS when a local installation is not possible. Please submit a helpdesk ticket from 

https://www.gemini.edu/sciops/helpdesk/submit-general-helpdesk-request 

to request a temporary account on this machine.


4. Launching GMMPS
=============================================================

Launch GMMPS directly from its installation directory:

    gmmps-<version>/bin/gmmps

More conveniently, add gmmps-<version>/bin to your PATH variable:

For 'bash' add this line your .bashrc:
export PATH=$PATH:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

For 'csh' add this line to your .cshrc:
setenv PATH ${PATH}:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

Open a new terminal and type:
gmmps &



5. Earlier versions of GMMPS
=============================================================

Earlier version of GMMPS on your system must be renamed, or 
removed from the PATH variable.

To ensure maximum compatibility and the best mask design, 
Gemini Observatory will NOT accept masks that have been 
designed with earlier versions of GMMPS.

GMMPS performs a version check upon startup, and will 
notify you if a new version of GMMPS has become available.
