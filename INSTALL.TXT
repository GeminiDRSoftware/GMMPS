Both pre-compiled binaries as well as the source code are
contained in the GMMPS distribution package. Installation 
instructions for both are given below.

The GMMPS users manual is available online at
   
   http://www.gemini.edu/node/10458


1. Dependencies
=============================================================

You must have 'skycat' installed. GMMPS was designed and 
tested for use with Skycat 3.1.2 and YOU MUST USE that 
version. Both installer scripts check the presence of the
required shared libraries.
You can download Skycat at:

   http://archive.eso.org/cms/tools-documentation/skycat/eso-skycat-download.html

NOTE for Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems:

Skycat and its associated Tcl/Tk modules are distributed as
rpm packages. To install them on a Debian-based system they 
must be converted to a 'deb' package using 'alien'. For example:

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install alien
   sudo alien -k tcltk-8.4.1-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
   sudo alien -k --scripts skycat-3.1.2-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
   sudo dpkg -i tcltk_8.4.1-1_amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i skycat_3.1.2-1_amd64.deb

NOTE for MacOS users:

You must use MacOS 10.6 or later. Earlier versions require an older
skycat library which is not supported anymore by GMMPS.


2. Source Code Installation Instructions (default)
=============================================================

Run:

    ./install.sh


3. Launching GMMPS
=============================================================

Launch GMMPS directly from its installation directory:

    gmmps-<version>/bin/gmmps

More conveniently, add gmmps-<version>/bin to your PATH variable:

For 'bash' add this line your .bashrc:
    export PATH=$PATH:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

For 'csh' add this line to your .cshrc:
    setenv PATH ${PATH}:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

Open a new terminal and type:
gmmps &



4. Earlier versions of GMMPS
=============================================================

Earlier version of GMMPS on your system must be renamed, or 
removed from the PATH variable.

To ensure maximum compatibility and the best mask design, 
Gemini Observatory will NOT accept masks that have been 
designed with earlier versions of GMMPS.

GMMPS performs a version check upon startup, and will 
notify you if a new version of GMMPS has become available.
