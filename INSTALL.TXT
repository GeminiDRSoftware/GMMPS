Both pre-compiled binaries as well as the source code may be
contained in the GMMPS distribution package. Installation 
instructions for both are given below.

The GMMPS users manual is available online at
   
   http://www.gemini.edu/node/10458


1. Dependencies
=============================================================

There should not be any. GMMPS now comes with all the
packages required to run it including Tcl/Tk and Skycat 3.1.4. 
If you chose to compile from sources, these will be compiled 
first. They are installed in the bin and lib directories of GMMPS
to keep them isolated from any other versions on your system.

2. Source Code Installation Instructions (default)
=============================================================

Run:

    ./install.sh


3. Launching GMMPS
=============================================================

Launch GMMPS directly from its installation directory:

    gmmps-<version>/bin/gmmps

More conveniently, add gmmps-<version>/bin to your PATH variable:

For 'bash' add this line your .bashrc:
    export PATH=$PATH:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

For 'csh' add this line to your .cshrc:
    setenv PATH ${PATH}:<PATH-TO-GMMPS>/gmmps-<version>/bin

Open a new terminal and type:
gmmps &



4. Earlier versions of GMMPS
=============================================================

Earlier version of GMMPS on your system must be renamed, or 
removed from the PATH variable.

To ensure maximum compatibility and the best mask design, 
Gemini Observatory will NOT accept masks that have been 
designed with earlier versions of GMMPS.

GMMPS performs a version check upon startup, and will 
notify you if a new version of GMMPS has become available.
