atmosphere.txt is based on measured Paranal atmospheric transmission at 
airmass 1.0 between 330 and 850nm with low sampling. The part redder than 
850nm was taken from the E-ELT atmospheric models (airmass 1.0, dry, very 
high resolution), mean filtered on a 10nm scale, and normalized so that 
it would smoothly fit to the optical throughput spectrum at 850nm.
Somewhat rought, but sufficiently good for GMMPS purposes.
GMOS-S_z_G0328 has been extended from 1000 to 1100nm using the essentially 
identical transmission curve from GMOS-N.

Y and Z band filters were sorted wrt. decreasing wavelengths, and the
throughput was in %. The GMOS-S Y-band filter had a tiny bump at around
700-800nm, which confused the automatic wavelength calculation, so I truncated
the data at 810nm.

The F2_HK_G0806.txt is spliced together from the F2_Kshort and the F2_HK 
filters, with a splice point at 2310nm; for the time being until data
are available.

The F2 quantum efficiency is my best guess given QE curves of other Teledyne
Hawaii-2 arrays and the J and K QEs actually measured for the F2 detector.
