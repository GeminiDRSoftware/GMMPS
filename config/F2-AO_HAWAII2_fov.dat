# This file defines:
# (1) Full detector extent
# (2) Illuminated field of view
# (3) Gaps (if any)

# NOTE: 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- Keywords must be sequential running through corners 1-8 (1-4 for gaps)
# --- All corners must be present (8 for FOV, 4 for gaps)
# --- All values must be in arc seconds
# --- All values are with respect to a fiducial pointing center
