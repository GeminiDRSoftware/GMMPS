GMOS-S data have been measured.
GMOS-N data are assumed to be very similar to GMOS-S
(dealing with different pixel scales etc inside gmmps tcl sources).

This table has the following matrix per grating (F2 example)

Lambda is calculated as:

lambda = c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + c3*x^3

The second column, running from 0-3, represents c0, c1, c2, c3

The 5 rows within c0, and the three rows within c1-c3, are:

c0: quadratic dependence on xslit and yslit, 5 free parameters,
numbered in the third column:
c0 = p0 + p1*xs + p2*xs^2 + p3*ys + p4*ys^2

p0...p4 depend on the CWL, parameterised as a quadratic function,
e.g.:
p0 = a + b*cwl + c*cwl^2
The a,b,c are found in columns 3-5


Therefore, the table is:
R1200_JH c0 p0  a b c
R1200_JH c0 p1  a b c
R1200_JH c0 p2  a b c
R1200_JH c0 p3  a b c
R1200_JH c0 p4  a b c
R1200_JH c1 p0  a b c
R1200_JH c1 p1  a b c
R1200_JH c1 p2  a b c
R1200_JH c2 p0  a b c
R1200_JH c2 p1  a b c
R1200_JH c2 p2  a b c
R1200_JH c3 p0  a b c
R1200_JH c3 p1  a b c
R1200_JH c3 p2  a b c
